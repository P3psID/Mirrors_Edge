Mirrors_Edge

The goal of this project is to have a connected mirror, in which you can see your reflexion, but also some information concerning your environment (weather, temperature, and more things)

In this README, I will only focus on the software / development part, because I want to keep this README relatively short and concise. So I will not develop the implementation of one-way mirror, the making of the frame in which the mirror will be placed, etc...

This project is more or less beginner friendly (I think), it will require to know the basics of :
    - HTML/CSS
    - JS and how APIs work
    - Python + Flask
    - Network computing (this one is not necessary, but we will deal a little with the IP and the ssh protocol to make our life easier)
    - Linux (in my case : Raspberry OS Lite)
