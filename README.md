Smart Screen

The goal of this project is to have a connected mirror, in which you can see your reflexion, but also some information concerning your environment (weather, temperature, and more things)

In this README, I will only focus on the web interface development part, and the implementation, because I want to keep this README relatively short and concise.

This project is more or less beginner friendly, it will require to know the basics of :
    - HTML/CSS
    - JS and how APIs work
    - Python + Flask
    - Linux (in my case : Raspberry OS Lite)
    - Systemd
